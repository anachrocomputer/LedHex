# LedHex #

This repository contains several programs to run on an Arduino
and drive a display made from LEDs.

## LedHexClock ##

Very simple four-digit clock with flashing colon.
So simple, in fact,
that there's no way to set the time.

TODO: add a way to set the time.

TODO: add 12/24 hour switch.

TODO: add other types of time display, TBD.

## LedHexCount4 ##

Display a four-digit counter on four LedHex PCBs connected in a chain.
Range is 0000-FFFF (0-65535).

## LedHexLampTest4 ##

Test a four-digit chain of LedHex PCBs by lighting up all the segments
in sequence.

## LedHexTest ##

Simply count 0-9, A-F repeatedly on a single digit display.

## LedHexTest4 ##

Test a four-digit chain of LedHex PCBs by lighting up all the segments
in sequence.
